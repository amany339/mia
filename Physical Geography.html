      <h1><b>Physical Geography</b></h1> 
      <h3>Definition of Physical Geography</h3> 
      <p> It is a branch of geography that focuses on studying the natural phenomena of the Earth, including landforms, climate, water resources, soil, vegetation, and the environmental factors affecting them. Physical geography aims to understand the natural processes that shape the Earth's surface and the changes that occur over time. It also seeks to analyze the interaction between the natural environment and human activities.
